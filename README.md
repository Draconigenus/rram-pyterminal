### DAC Sources
There're two DAC sources: "**VTGT_BL**" and "**ADC_CAL**", where each of them can be 0 ~ 3V3 with 12 bit resolution.
- **VTGT_BL**: Target voltage for the bit lines. (Nominal range: 80 ~ 200 mV)
- **ADC_CAL**: Used for ADC calibration mode, where the input of ADC would be this voltage source instead of bit lines.
